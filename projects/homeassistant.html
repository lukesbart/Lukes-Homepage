    <h1 style="text-align: center;">Home Assitant with Arduino</h1>

    <p>This project is a project meant to build off of the full stack knowledge that I have gained over the past few months. I have an Arduino Uno R4 that has wifi capabilites, a screen, microphone, and speaker. Putting all of these parts together along with a natural direction of AI made me want to try to create a home assistant using Arduino. As of the publication of this page I have gotten sounds playing through the speaker and text displaying on my screen.</p>
