    <p>This project is building off of the knowledge that I gained in my class Organization of Programming Languages during my last semester at Southern Adventist University. In this class the curriculum worked through the book <a href="https://craftinginterpreters.com">Crafting Interpreters</a> by Robert Nystrom. For this project I have written an HTML parser and am currently working with a terminal UI library to display the text in a way that the user can navigate.</p>
